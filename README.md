# Tic-Tac-Toe
##This piece of code allows two players to play a standard game of 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe. Each time running the program activates a single game.  Choose 1 player to be Player 1 (X’s) and one to be Player 2 (O’s).  Player 1 will go first.  When it is your turn, select a space by entering a code from the following table:
##top left, left top - top middle, middle top - top right, right top
##middle left, left middle - middle middle, center - right middle, middle right
##bottom left, left bottom - bottom middle, middle bottom - bottom right, right bottom
##Entering anything else, or trying to take a space that has already been taken, will re-prompt the current player to choose a space.  The game will end when one player achieves 3 letters in a row, or when the board is full.
